//! A collection of lazy initialized values that are created by `Future`s.
//!
//! [OnceCell]'s API should be familiar to anyone who has used the
//! [`once_cell`](https://crates.io/crates/once_cell) crate or the proposed `std::cell::OnceCell`.
//! It provides an async version of a cell that can only be initialized once, permitting tasks to
//! wait on the initialization if it is already running instead of racing multiple initialization
//! tasks.
//!
//! Unlike threads, tasks can be cancelled at any point where they block.  [OnceCell] deals with
//! this by allowing another initializer to run if the task currently initializing the cell is
//! dropped.  This also allows for fallible initialization using [OnceCell::get_or_try_init], and
//! for the initializing `Future` to contain borrows or use references to thread-local data.
//!
//! [Lazy] takes the opposite approach: it wraps a single `Future` which is cooperatively run to
//! completion by any polling task.  This requires that the initialization function be independent
//! of the calling context, but will never restart an initializing function just because the
//! surrounding task was cancelled.
//!
//! # Overhead
//!
//! Both cells use two `usize`s to store state and do not retain any allocations after
//! initialization is complete.  [OnceCell] and [Lazy] only allocate if there is contention.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! ## The `critical-section` feature
//!
//! If this feature is enabled, the [`critical-section`](https://crates.io/crates/critical-section)
//! crate is used instead of an `std` mutex.  You must depend on that crate and select a locking
//! implementation; see [its documentation](https://docs.rs/critical-section/) for details.
//!
//! ## The `unpin` feature
//!
//! This feature enables the `unpin` module which contains an alternative API for [Lazy] that does
//! not rely on pinning the object during initialization, even for futures that are not [Unpin].
//! In general, prefer the types in the crate root and, if needed, box futures to make them unpin.
//!
//! ## The `std` feature
//!
//! This is currently a no-op, but might in the future be used to expose APIs that depends on
//! types only in `std`.  It does *not* control the locking implementation.
